## 5.5: Zeros of Polynomial Functions


---
In-class notes
- Descartes rule of signs
  - If you want to know the type of solutions
  - Note that this will fail if you have zeros
  - Sum in each line must be the degree of the polynomial
  - Count how many times the sign changes (variation of signs)
  - For example $x^5 - x^4 + 7x^3 - 7x^2 + 12x - 12$
    - This has five changes of signs
      - `+ -> - -> + -> - -> + -> -`
      - `0    1    2    3    4    5`
  - $P(-x) = (-x)^5 - (-x)^4 + 7(-x)^3 - 7(-x)^2 + 12(-x) - 12$
    - $P(-x) = -x^5 - x^4 - 7x^3 - 7x^2 - 12x - 12$
  - From each number that is more than one, start subtracting twos

| + | - | $i$ |
|---|---|-----|
| 5 | 0 | 0   |
| 3 | 0 | 2   |
| 1 | 0 | 4   |
- Based on Descartes rule of signs, we would predict one positive solution and four complex solutions
