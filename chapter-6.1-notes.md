## 6.1: Exponential Functions
### Identifying Exponential Functions

In-class notes
- For exponential functions, domain is all real numbers, y > 0, horizontal asymptote: y = 0
- 1 always pairs up with the base itself
- 0 pairs up with 1
- -1 pairs up with the reciprocal of the base
- What is within the parentheses with x (independent variable) is a left/right shift
  - Subtraction shifts the graph to the right
  - $2^{x - 1}$ means you shift the graph to the right
  - Each x coordinate of your ordered pairs gets one added to it
  - Addition shifts the graph to the left
  - $2^{x + 1}$ means you shift the graph to the left
  - Each x coordinate of your ordered pairs gets one subtracted from it
- If something is outside the parentheses with y (dependent variable) it is an up/down shift
  - Subtraction shifts the graph down
  - $2^x - 1$ shifts the graph down
  - Addition shifts the graph up
  - $2^x + 1$ shifts the graph up
  - For translations to the dependent variable, you apply them to the horizontal asymptote as well
- These are "rigid" translations
- To begin graphing an exponential function, you need to isolate the "parent function"
  - Original function: $f(x) = -2 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^{x+2} - 1$
  - Parent function: $y = (\frac{1}{3})^x$
  - Then you add items that affect x
  - Next step: $y = (\frac{1}{3})^{x + 2}$
  - Next step: $y = -2 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^{x + 2}$
  - Next step: $y = -2 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^{x + 2} - 1$
- $y = f(cx)$
  - each x value is multiplied by the factor of $\frac{1}{c}$
- $y = cf(x)$
  - each y value is multiplied by factor of $c$
- Find an exponential function that passes through the two points
  - $y = a \cdot b^x$
    - (0, 6) and (3, 750)
    - $6 = c \cdot b^0$
      - $a = 6$
    - $750 = c \cdot b^3$
      - $\frac{750}{6} = \frac{6}{6} \cdot b^3$
      - $\sqrt[3]{b^3} = \sqrt[3]{125}$
      - $b = 5$
    - $y = 6 \cdot 5^x$
