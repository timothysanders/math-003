## 5.1: Quadratic Functions

### Recognizing Characteristics of Parabolas
- The graph of a quadratic equation is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. It has an extreme point, called the **vertex**.
  - If the parabola opens upward, the vertex is the lowest point on the graph (or the minimum value of the quadratic function)
  - If the parabola opens downward, the vertex is the highest point on the graph (or the maximum value of the quadratic function)
- The graph of a quadratic function is symmetric with a vertical line that goes through the vertex, called the **axis of symmetry**
- The y-intercept is the point at which the parabola crosses the y-axis and the x-intercepts (plural) are the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis. If x-intercepts exist, they represent the **zeros** or **roots** of the quadratic function, the values of x at which y = 0

### Understanding How the Graphs of Parabolas are Related to Their Quadratic Functions
- **General form of a quadratic function**: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
  - $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers and $a \ne 0$
  - If $a \gt 0$, then the parabola opens upward
  - If $a \lt 0$, then the parabola opens downward
- The axis of symmetry is defined by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ and the vertex always occurs along the axis of symmetry
  - This is derived from the quadratic formula
- **Standard form of a quadratic function**: $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$
  - $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola
  - This form is also called the **vertex form of a quadratic function**
  - Similar to the general for, if $a \gt 0$, then the parabola opens upward and the vertex is a minimum
  - If $a \lt 0$, then the parabola opens downward and the vertex is a maximum
  - ![Parabola example](images/figure-05.1.5.jpg)
  - This example represents the graph of the equation $y = -3(x + 2)^2 + 4$
- $y = x^2$
  - ![Parabola example](images/figure-05.1.6.jpg)
- If $k \gt 0$, then the graph shifts upward, if $k \lt 0$, then the graph shifts downward
- If $h \gt 0$, then the graph shifts towards the right, if $h \lt 0$, then the graph shifts to the left
- Magnitude of $a$ indicates the stretch of the graph, if $|a| \gt 1$ the point associated with a particular x value shifts farther from the x-axis, but if $|a| \lt 1$, then the point shifts closer to the x-axis
- Standard form and general form describe the same function
##### Forms of Quadratic Functions
- Quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree two and its graph is a parabola
- The **general form of a quadratic function** is $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers and $a \ne 0$
- The **standard form of a quadratic function** is $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ where $a \ne 0$. The vertex $(h, k)$ is located at $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$
##### How To
- Given a graph of a quadratic function, write the equation of the function in general form
  1. Identify the horizontal shift of the parabola; this value is $h$. Identify the vertical shift of the parabola; this value is $k$
  2. Substitute the values of the horizontal and vertical shift for $h$ and $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$
  3. Substitute the values of any point, other than the vertex, on the graph of the parabola for $x$ and $f(x)$
  4. Solve for the stretch factor, $|a|$
  5. Expand and simplify to write in general form
##### Examples
##### How To
- Given a quadratic function in general form, find the vertex of the parabola
  1. Identify $a$, $b$, and $c$
  2. Find $h$, the x-coordinate of the vertex by substituting $a$ and $b$ into $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$
  3. Find $k$, the y-coordinate of the vertex, by evaluating $k = f(h) = f(-\frac{b}{2a})$

### Finding the Domain and Range of a Quadratic Function
- Any number can be an input value of a quadratic function, which means that the domain of any quadratic function is all real numbers.
- Because parabolas have a maximum or a minimum point, the range is restricted. Depending on whether the parabola opens up or down, the range will be all values greater/less than the turning point
##### Domain and Range of a Quadratic Function
- Domain of any quadratic function is all real numbers (unless the context presents some restrictions)
- Range of a quadratic function in general form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ with a positive $a$ value is $f(x) \geq f(-\frac{b}{2a})$ or $[f(-\frac{b}{2a}), \infty)$, with a negative $a$ value $f(x) \leq f(-\frac{b}{2a})$ or $(-\infty, f(-\frac{b}{2a})]$
- Range of a quadratic function in standard form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ with a positive $a$ value is $f(x) \geq k$, with a negative $a$ value is $f(x) \leq k$
##### How To
- Given a quadratic function, find the domain and range
  1. Identify the domain of any quadratic function as all real numbers
  2. Determine whether $a$ is positive or negative. If $a$ is positive, the parabola has a minimum, if $a$ is negative, the parabola has a maximum
  3. Determine the maximum or minimum value of the parabola, $k$
  4. If the parabola has a minimum, the range is given by $f(x) \geq k$, or $[k, \infty)$. If the parabola has a maximum, the range is given by $f(x) \leq k$, or $(-\infty, k]$

### Determining the Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic Functions
- The output of the quadratic function at the vertex is the maximum/minimum (depending on orientation)
#### Finding the x- and y-intercepts of a Quadratic Function
- The y-intercept of a quadratic is found by evaluating the function at an input of 0
- The x-intercepts of a quadratic is found by evaluating where the output is 0
  - There may be 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts
  - ![x-intercept examples](images/figure-05.1.13.jpg)
##### How To
- Given a quadratic function $f(x)$, find the y and x intercepts
  1. Evaluate $f(0)$ to find the y-intercept
  2. Solve the quadratic equation $f(x) = 0$ to find the x-intercepts
#### Rewriting Quadratics in Standard Form
- For some quadratics, they can be easily solved by factoring, others cannot. For these, we need to rewrite them in standard form
##### How To
- Given a quadratic function, find the x-intercepts by rewriting in standard form
  1. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$
  2. Substitute $x = h$ into the general form of the quadratic function to find $k$
  3. Rewrite the quadratic in standard form using $h$ and $k$
  4. Solve for when the output of the function will be zero to find the x-intercepts
