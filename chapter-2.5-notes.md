## 2.5: Quadratic Equations
### Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring
- An equation that contains a second degree polynomial is called a quadratic equation, for example $2x^2 + 3x - 1$ and $x^2 - 4 = 0$. The easiest way to solve a quadratic equation is usually through factoring, or finding expressions that can be multiplied together to produce the expression on one side of the equation.
- Solving by factoring depends on the zero-product property, which is if $a \cdot b = 0$ then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers or algebraic equations
- Multiplying the factors expands the equation to a string of terms separated by plus or minus signs, the multiplication undoes the factoring.
  - Example: $(x - 2)(x + 3) = x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6 = x^2 + x - 6$
- The process of factoring a quadratic equation depends on the leading coefficient, if it is 1 or another integer
- Standard form of the quadratic equation is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers ans $a \ne 0$
##### The Zero-Product Property and Quadratic Equations
- The **zero-product property** states
  - If $a \cdot b = 0$ then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$,
- where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers or algebraic equations
- A **quadratic equation** is an equation containing a second-degree polynomial
  - $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- Where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and if $a \ne 0$, it is in the standard form
#### Solving Quadratics with a Leading Coefficient of 1
- In the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$, the leading coefficient of $x^2$ is 1. There is one method to factor quadratic equations in this form
##### How To
- Given a quadratic equation with the leading coefficient of 1, factor it
  1. Find two numbers whose product equals $c$ and whose sum equals $b$
  2. Use those two numbers to write two factors of the form $(x + k)$ or $(x - k)$, where $k$ is one of the numbers found in step 1. Use the numbers exactly as they are. In other words, if the two numbers are 1 and -2, the factors are $(x + 1)(x - 2)$
  3. Solve using the zero-product property by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variable
##### Examples
- Factor and solve $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$
  - $(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0$
  - $x + 3 = 0; x = -3$
  - $x - 2 = 0; x = 2$
- Factor and solve $x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0$
  - $(x - 6)(x + 1) = 0$
  - $x = 6$
  - $x = -1$
- Factor and solve $x^2 + 8x + 15 = 0$
  - $(x + 5)(x + 3) = 0$
  - $x = -5$
  - $x = -3$
- Factor and solve $x^2 - 4x - 21 = 0$
  - $(x - 7)(x + 3) = 0$
  - $x = 7$
  - $x = -3$
- Factor and solve $x^2 - 9 = 0$
  - $(x + 3)(x - 3) = 0$
  - $x = -3$
  - $x = 3$
- Factor and solve $x^2 - 25 = 0$
  - $(x + 5)(x - 5) = 0$
  - $x = 5$
  - $x = -5$
#### Solving a Quadratic Equation by Factoring when the Leading Coefficient is not 1
- When the leading coefficient is not 1, we factor using a method called grouping, which requires four terms. The procedures are as follows
  1. With the quadratic in standard form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, multiply $a \cdot c$
  2. Find the two numbers whose product equals $ac$ and whose sum equals $b$
  3. Rewrite the equation replacing the $bx$ term with two terms using the numbers found in step 2 as coefficients of $x$
  4. Factor the first two terms and then factor the last two terms. The expressions in parentheses must be exactly the same to use grouping
  5. Factor out the expression in parentheses
  6. Set the expressions equal to zero and solve for the variable
- Example: $4x^2 + 15x + 9 = 0$
  - $4 \cdot 9 = 36$
  - $36 = 12 \cdot 3; 12 + 3 = 15$
  - $4x^2 + 12x + 3x + 9 = 0$
  - $4x(x + 3) + 3(x + 3) = 0$
  - $(4x + 3)(x + 3) = 0$
  - $4x + 3 = 0$
    - $4x = -3$
    - $x = -\frac{3}{4}$
  - $x = -3$
- $12x^2 + 11x + 2 = 0$
  - $12 \cdot 2 = 24$
  - $24 = 8 \cdot 3; 8 + 3 = 11$
  - $12x^2 + 8x + 3x + 2 = 0$
  - $4x(3x + 2) + 1(3x + 2) = 0$
  - $(4x + 1)(3x + 2) = 0$
  - $4x + 1 = 0$
    - $x = -\frac{1}{4}$
  - $3x + 2 = 0
    - $-\frac{2}{3}$
### Using the Square Root Property
- When there is no linear term in the equation, another method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the **square root property**. With this property, we isolate the $x^2$ term and take the square root of the number on the other side of the equals sign. This may require some manipulation of the equation
##### The Square Root Property
- With the $x^2$ term isolated, the square root property states that
  - if $x^2 = k$, then $x = \pm \sqrt{k}$
- where $k$ is a nonzero real number
##### How To
- Given a quadratic equation with an $x^2$ term but no $x$ term, use the square root property to solve it
  1. Isolate the $x^2$ term on one side of the equal sign
  2. Take the square root of both sides of the equation, putting a $\pm$ sign before the expression on the side opposite the squared term
  3. Simplify the numbers on the side with the $\pm$ sign. 
#### Examples
- $x^2 = 8$
  - $x = \sqrt{8} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}$
  - $x = \pm2\sqrt{2}$
- $4x^2 + 1 = 7$
  - $4x^2 = 6$
  - $x = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{4}}$
  - $x = \pm\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$
- $3(x - 4)^2 = 15$
  - $(x - 4)^2 = 5$
  - $x - 4 = \pm\sqrt{5}$
  - $x = 4 \pm \sqrt{5}$
### Completing the Square
- Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved in their original form using the square root property. In such cases, we can use a method called **completing the square**. With this method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of the equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equation, then apply the square root property. To complete the square, the leading coefficient must be 1, if not, divide the entire equation by $a$.
- Example: $x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0$
  1. Given a quadratic equation that cannot be factored, and with $a = 1$, first add or subtract the constant term to the right side of the equal sign
     - $x^2 + 4x = -1$
  2. Multiply the $b$ term by $\frac{1}{2}$ and square it
     - $\frac{1}{2}(4) = 2$
     - $2^2 = 4$
  3. Add $(\frac{1}{2}b)^2$ to both sides of the equal sign and simplify the right side. We have
     - $x^2 + 4x + 4 = -1 + 4$
     - $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 3$
  4. The left side of the equation can now be factored as a perfect square
     - $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 3$
     - $(x + 2)^2 = 3$
  5. Use the square root property and solve
     - $\sqrt{(x + 2)^2} = \pm \sqrt{3}$
     - $x + 2 = \pm \sqrt{3}$
     - $x = -2 \pm \sqrt{3}$
### Using the Quadratic Formula
- The quadratic formula is a formula that will solve all quadratic equations, although it works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to make errors substituting values into the formula
  1. First move the constant term to the right side of the equal sign
     - $ax^2 + bx = -c$
  2. As we want the leading coefficient equal to 1, divide through by $a$
     - $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}$
  3. Then, find $\frac{1}{2}$ of the middle term, and add $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{b}{a})^2 = \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$ to both sides of the equal sign
     - $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}$
  4. Next, write the left side as a perfect square. Find the common denominator of the right side and write it as a single fraction
     - $(x + \frac{b}{2x})^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$
  5. Now, use the square root property, which gives
     - $x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$
     - $x + \frac{b}{2a} = \frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
  6. Finally, add $-\frac{b}{2a}$ to both sides of the equation and combine the terms on the right side.
     - $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
##### The Quadratic Formula
- Written in standard form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, any quadratic equation can be solved using the **quadratic formula**
  - $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
- where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers and $a \ne 0$
##### How To
- Given a quadratic equation, solve it using the quadratic formula
  1. Make sure the equation is in the standard form: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
  2. Make note of the values of the coefficients and constant term, $a$, $b$, and $c$
  3. Carefully substitute the values noted in step 2 into the equation. The avoid needless errors, use parentheses around each number input into the formula
  4. Calculate and solve
##### Examples
- $x^2 + 5x + 1 = 0$
  - $a = 1; b = 5, c = 1$
  - $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$
  - $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}$
### The Discriminant
- The discriminant is the expression under the radical, $b^2 - 4ac$. This tells us whether the solutions are real numbers or complex numbers, and how many solutions of each type to expect

|         Value of Discriminant         | Results                                 |
|:-------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------|
|            $b^2 - 4ac = 0$            | One rational solution (double solution) |
|    $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, perfect square    | Two rational solutions                  |
| $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, not a perfect square | Two irrational solutions                |
|            $b^2 - 4ac < 0$            | Two complex solutions                   |
##### The Discriminant
- For $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, the **discriminant** is the expression under the radical in the quadratic formula: $b^2 - 4ac$. It tells us whether the solutions are real numbers or complex numbers and how many solutions of each type to expect.
##### Examples
- $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0$
- $8x^2 + 14x + 3 = 0$
- $3x^2 - 5x - 2 = 0$
- $3x^2 - 10x + 15 = 0$

### Using the Pythagorean Theorem
- Pythagorean theorem is based on a right triangle, it states the relationship among the lengths of the sides as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ refer to the legs of the right triangle and $c$ refers to the hypotenuse.
- Example: $a^2 + 4^2 = 12^12$
  - $a^2 + 16 = 144$
  - $a^2 = 128$
  - $a = \sqrt{128} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 16}$
  - $a = 8\sqrt{2}$

In-class notes
- First question, do you see zero on the other side, then "is there a common factor?"
  - If you have a negative sign in all terms, that means you have a common factor of `-1`
    - Divide by -1 and turn everything to a positive sign
- If you have a polynomial of a higher degree, you will have a number of solutions equal to the highest degree
- Square root property
  - $x^2 = 7$
    - $x = \pm \sqrt{7}$
  - $-3(x + 1)^2 + 2 = 5$
    - The square root property requires a perfect square somewhere and no other x around
    - $-3(x + 1)^2 = 3$
    - $(x + 1)^2 = -1$
    - $x + 1 = \pm i$
    - $x = -1 \pm i$
    - Whenever you see a negative number under the square root, i jumps out
      - $\sqrt{12} = i\sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = 2i\sqrt{3}$
  - $-3(x + 1)^2 + 2x = 5$
    - This does not fit to the square root property, so you need to "remove" the parentheses and start over
    - $-3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 2x - 5 = 0$
      - $(a + b)^2$
    - $-3x^2 - 6x - 3 + 2x - 5 = 0$
    - $-3x^2 - 4x - 8 = 0$
    - $3x^2 + 4x + 8 = 0$
      - Use quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}$
      - $x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 3}$
      - $x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-80}}{6}$
        - If b is even
      - $x = \frac{-4 \pm i\sqrt{16 \cdot 5}}{6} = \frac{-4 \pm4i\sqrt{5}}{6} = \frac{-2 \pm2i\sqrt{5}}{3}$
        - $i = \sqrt{-1}$
          - $\sqrt{-4} = 2i$
        - $i^2 = -1$
- $4(x - 1)^2 -1 = 5$
  - $4(x - 1)^2 = 6$
  - $\sqrt{(x - 1)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$
- $4(x - 1)^2 + 3(2 - x)^2 - 1 = 7x$
  - "Bring down to a quadratic equation" what should I do to make it look like a quadratic equation?
  - First step is to remove the parentheses and start over
  - $4(x - 1)^2 + 3(2 - x)^2 - 1 = 7x$
    - $4(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 3(4 - 4x + x^2) - 1 - 7x = 0$
    - $4x^2 - 8x + 4 + 12 - 12x + 3x^2 - 1 - 7x = 0$
    - $7x^2 - 27x + 15 = 0$
    - $x = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{(-27)^2 - 4 \cdot 7 \cdot 15}}{14} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{309}}{14}$
    - $x = \frac{27}{14} \pm \frac{\sqrt{309}}{14}$
