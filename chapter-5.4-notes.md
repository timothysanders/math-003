## 5.4: Dividing Polynomials

### Using Long Division to Divide Polynomials
- Long division for ordinary arithmetic begins by dividing into the digits of the dividend that have the greatest place value. We divide, multiply, subtract and include the digit in the next place value position, and repeat

In-class notes
- "zero of polynomial function", "x intercept", "root", "solution"
  - These all represent "where you cross the x-axis"
- Long division
  - Simple example: $y = x^2 - 5x + 6$ (quadratic function)
    - Leading coefficient is one
    - Degree is two
    - y-intercept, let x = 0; y = 6
    - x-intercept, let y = 0
      - $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$
      - $(x - 3)(x - 2) = 0$; $x = 3; x = 2$
    - Dividing $\frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x - 3} = x - 2$
  - $y = x^2 - 3x + 1$ can not be factored
    - y-intercept = 1
    - Therefore, use the quadratic function
    - $= \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$
  - Once you can get to the quadratic function form, you are easily able to solve (though not always with nice numbers)
    - First choice should always be to factor the polynomial
  - If you have a factor, your polynomial is fully divisible by the divisor
    - This means you do not have any remainder
    - For example 35 / 5; "5 is a factor of 35 because $\frac{35}{5} = 7$"
  - $x^2 - 5x + 6 \div (x - 3)$
    - Make sure everything is in descending order
    - Divisor: x - 3
    - Dividend
    - Take the leading term of the divisor and see how many times it goes into the dividend
      - Then you change the signs and add (don't subtract)
    - Solutions for our division/factoring can only involve numbers that are factors of the coefficient of $a_0x^0$ (the "free number")
      - Can plug in one of our factors into the function, if it is equal to zero, then it is a solution
- Synthetic division
  - If you are doing factoring of your polynomials and you are lucky, then they will be factors of $ac$ from your original function
  - You need to check if there are factors that are closely related to the "free number"
  - The only numbers that make you polynomial equal zero are your solutions
- 
- "Check if x = 2 is a zero of P(x)"
  - If you replace x with two, will P(2) = 0? Will your remainder be 0?
- "Check if x - 2 is a factor of P(x)"
  - Need to do synthetic division and check if the remainder is 0
- When graphing a polynomial solution, you need to find the rational solutions for the polynomial
- The remainder that you get from either long division or synthetic division is the value that you get for the particular divisor
