## 3.1: Functions and Function Notation
### Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function
- A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs, and the set of the first components of each ordered pair is called the **domain** and the set of second components is called the **range**.
  - Example ${(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10)}$
    - Domain: ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$
    - Range: ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$
  - Each value in the domain is also called an **input** value, or **independent variable**, often labeled with $x$
  - Each value in the range is also known as an **output** value, or **dependent variable**, often labeled with $y$

##### Function
- A **function** is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly one output value. We say "the output is a function of the input".
- The **input** values make up the **domain**, and the **output** values make up the range
##### How To
- Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the relationship is a function
  1. Identify the input values
  2. Identify the output values
  3. If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function
#### Using Function Notation
- A standard function notation helps facilitate working with functions, the letters $f$, $g$, and $h$ are often used to represent functions
  - Example, "height is a function of age", $h$ can be used for height, and $a$ for age. Then we have $h \text{is} f \text{of} a$
  - Use parentheses to indicate the function input: $h = f(a)$
  - The function is named $f$, and is read as "f of a"
  - Any letter can be used to name a function and algebraic expressions can be passed as input to a function
##### Function Notation
- The notation $y = f(x)$ defines a function named $f$. The is read as "y is a function of x", where the letter x represents the input value, or independent variable, while y (or $f(x)$), represents the output value, or dependent variable
#### Representing Functions Using Tables

## In-class notes
- Function definition: "For every `x`, there is one and only one `y`"
  - Function is a set of ordered pairs, where for each `x`, there is one and only one `y`
  - `x` represents the domain or independent variable
  - `y` represents the range or dependent variable
  - **Domain** is the difference between the minimum and the maximum value of x
    - Domain is the width of the picture frame
  - **Range** is the difference between the minimum and the maximum value of y
    - Range is the height of the picture frame
- "Vertical line test" - if you draw vertical lines on your graph, the vertical line crosses the function graph only once
- `f(x)` $y = x$ - linear function
- `g(x)` $y = 3x - 1$ - linear function
- `h(x)` $y = 2\sqrt{x} - 3$
  - "Solve for h of 1 = `h(1)`"
  - $y = 2\sqrt{1} - 3$
- This is **functional notation**
- $f(x) = 2x^2$
- $g(x) = 5\sqrt{x - 3} + 1$
- $m(x) = 5|x + 3|$
- $p(x) = \frac{-2}{x}$
- $p(-4) - 3m(-4) + f(-4) \cdot g(-4)$
  - $p(-4) = \frac{-2}{-4} = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $m(-4) = 5|-4 + 3| = 5$
  - $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 = 48$
  - $g(-4) = 5\sqrt{x + 5} + 1 = 6$
  - $\frac{1}{2} - 15 + 48 \cdot 6 = 273\frac{1}{2}$
