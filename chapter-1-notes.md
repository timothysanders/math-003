# Chapter 1: Prerequisites
## 1.1 Real Numbers: Algebra Essentials
- `natural numbers`: numbers used for counting/enumerating items. Can use set notation $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
- `whole numbers`: the set of natural numbers plus zero: $\{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$
- `integers`: add to the set of whole numbers the opposites of each number $\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$
  - Three subsets of integers, negative integers, zero, and positive integers
- `rational numbers`: fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and the denominator, and the denominator can never be zero
  - $\{\frac{m}{n} | m\space\text{and}\space n\space\text{are integers and}\space n \ne 0\}$
- `terminating decimal`: $\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$
- `repeating decimal`: $\frac{4}{11} = 0.36363636... \space0.\overline{36}$
- `irrational numbers`: numbers that cannot be written as a fraction of two integers
  - $\{h | h \space\text{is not a rational number}\}$
- `real numbers`: the set of both rational and irrational numbers
  - Similar to integers, these can be divided into sets of negative real numbers, zero, and positive real numbers
  - You can put these numbers on a number line

  - N: the set of natural numbers
  - W: the set of whole numbers
  - I: the set of integers
  - Q: the set of rational numbers
  - Q': the set of irrational numbers
### Performing Calculations Using the Order of Operations
- Order of operations must be evaluated in a systematic order, typical acronym is **PEMDAS**
  - **P**(arenthesis)
  - **E**(xponents)
  - **M**(ultiplication) and **D**(ivision)
  - **A**(ddition) and **S**(ubtraction)
- For a mathematical expression, simplify it using order of operations
  - Step 1. Simplify any expression with grouping symbols
  - Step 2. Simplify any expressions containing exponents or radicals
  - Step 3. Perform any multiplication in order, from left to right
  - Step 4. Perform any addition and subtraction in order, from left to right
### Using Properties of Real Numbers
- **Commutative properties are associated with repositioning**
  - For example, $5 + 2 = 2 + 5$ and $5 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 5$
  - `commutative property of addition`: numbers may be added in any order without affecting the sum
  - `commutative property of multiplication`: numbers may be multiplied in any order without affecting the product
- **Associative properties refer to regrouping**
  - $5 + (2 + 3) = (5 + 2) + 3$ and $5 \cdot (2 \cdot 3) = (5 \cdot 2) \cdot 3$
  - Or $a(bc) = (ab)c$
  - `associative property of multiplication`: does not matter how we group numbers when multiplying
  - `associative property of addition`: numbers may be grouped differently without affecting the sum
- Distributive property combines addition and multiplication
  - `distributive property`: the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times each term in the sum
  - $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
  - Ex: $15(121) = 15(100 + 20 + 1) = 15 \cdot 100 + 15 \cdot 20 + 15 \cdot 1 = 1500 + 300 + 15 = 1815$
  - Ex: $a(b + c - d + e) = ab + ac - ad + ae$
- Identity properties
  - `identity property of addition`: states that there is a unique number, called "additive identity" (0), that, when added to a number, results in the original number
    - $a + 0 = a$
  - `identity property of multiplication`: states that there is a unique number, called "multiplicative identity" (1), that, when multiplied by a number, results in the original number
    - $a \cdot 1 = a$
- Inverse properties
  - `inverse property of addition`: for every real number, there is a unique number that when added to the original number results in the additive identity(opposite)
    - $a + (-a) = 0$
  - `inverse property of multiplication`: for all real numbers (except 0), there is a unique number, called the "multiplicative inverse" (reciprocal) that, when multiplied by the original number, results in the multiplicative identity (1)
    - $a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 1$
    - $\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = 1$
    - This does not apply to zero because $\frac{1}{0}$ is undefined
- Expression versus equation
  - An expression is something that does not have a "solution", you can simplify or evaluate
  - An equation is something that is "solved", if a sentence has "is" in it, it is an equation
- Examples
  - $12x^3y^7 - 9x^4y^2 - 2x^8y^3 = 3x^3y^2(4y^5 - 3x - x^5y)$
  - $2\pi r(r + h) = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$
  - $2(L + W) = 2L + 2W$
  - $4y^3 + y = y(4y^2 + 1)$
  - $2x^2y^3 - 4xy + 6x^7y^9 = 2xy(xy^2 - 2 + 3x^6y^8)$
  - $3x + 6 = 3(x + 2)$
  - $3x + 7 = 5(\frac{3}{5}x + \frac{7}{5})$
  - $17xy + 13x^3w = 7z(\frac{17xy}{7z} + \frac{13x^3w}{7z})$
  - $12 - 2(3 - (6 - 5)^2 + (4 - 5)^3 - 2 \div(3-5)) = 12 - 2(3 - 1 - 1 + 1) = 12 - 4 = 8$
  - $5l \div 3l \times (9-6) = \frac{5l}{3l} \times 3 = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{1} = 5$
  - $-5 + 2(3 - (4 - 5)^3 - (3 - 4)^2 + 3 \div(4-1) = -5 + 2(3 - -1 - 1 + 3 \div3) = -5 + 2(3 + 1 - 1 + 1) = -5 + 2(4) = -5 + 8 = 3$
