## 2.2: Linear Equations in One Variable
### Solving Linear Equations in One Variable
- A **linear equation** is an equation of a straight line, written in one variable (the only power of the variable is 1), and may take the form $ax + b = 0$. These are solved using basic algebraic operations
- Linear equations in one variable can be classified as one of three types, identity, conditional, or inconsistent. The **solution set** for an equation is all values that make the equation true. 
- An $identity equation$ is true for all values of the variable
  - Example: $3x = 2x + x$
  - For identity equations, the solution set is the set of all real numbers
- A **conditional equation** is true only for some values of the variable
  - Example: $5x + 2 = 3x - 6$
  - The solution set for this equation is only one number, -4
- An **inconsistent equation** results in a false statement
  - For these equations, there is no solution
##### Linear equation in one variable
- A linear equation in one variable can be written in the form $ax + b = 0$, where a and b are real numbers and $a \ne 0$
##### Examples
- $2x + 7 = 19$
  - $2x = 12$
  - $x = 6$

#### Examples
- Given two points, **write the equation of the line** passing through these points $(5, 4)$ and $(-1, 0)$
  - Write the template of the equation for a line
    - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - Find what you have in the equation
    - Choose the point that has zero in it as your $(x_1, y_1)$ point
      - In this example $x_1 = -1,\space y_1=0, x_2=5, \space y_2 = 4$
    - Calculate the slope (from our first example above): $\frac{0 - 4}{-1 -5} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}$
    - Now that we have the slope, we can plug in the rest of the numbers
      - $y - 0 = \frac{2}{3}(x - (-1))$
      - $y = \frac{2}{3}(x + 1)$
      - $y = \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{2}{3}$
- **Write the equation of a line** passing through $(5, 7)$ and having y-int of $(0, 3)$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - $m = \frac{3 - 7}{0 - 5} = \frac{-4}{-5} = \frac{4}{5}$
  - $x_1 = 5, y_1 = 7$ and $x_2 = 0, y_2 = 3$
  - $y - 3 = \frac{4}{5}(x - 0)$
    - distribute and simplify
    - $y = \frac{4}{5}x + 3$
  - In this instance, we have the y-intercept explicitly listed, so we could use $y = mx + b$
- **Write the equation of a line** passing through $(5, 2)$ and having x-int of $(2, 0)$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - $m = \frac{2 - 0}{5 - 2} = \frac{2}{3}$
  - $y = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$
  - $y = \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{4}{3}$
- **Write the equation of a line** passing through $(2, 5)$ and parallel (perpendicular) to the given line $2x - 3y = 6$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - Set y equal to zero to get the x-intercept $2x - 3(0) = 6$
    - $2x = 6$
    - $x = 3$
    - X-intercept = $(3, 0)$
  - Set x equal to zero to get the y-intercept $2(0) - 3y = 6$
    - Y-intercept = $(0, -2)$
  - Find the slope of the given line
    - $m = \frac{2}{3}$
  - Parallel line has the same slope and a given point of $(2, 5)$
    - $y - 5 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$
    - $y = \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{11}{3}$
  - For perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal
    - $m = -\frac{3}{2}$
    - $y - 5 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 2)$
      - $y - 5 = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$
      - $y = -\frac{3}{2} + 8$

- Need to be able to chose which form of the linear equation makes sense for the problem
  - $y = mx + b$
  - $y_2 - y_1 = m(x_2 - x_1)$ - go with this one
  - $ax + by = c$
  - $m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

- Write the equation of the line passing through these two points $(1, 3)$ and $(5, 5)$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - $y - 3 = m(x - 1)$
  - $m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2}$
    - $m = \frac{3 - 5}{1 - 5}$
    - $m = \frac{-2}{-4} = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $y - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}$
  - $y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2}$
- Write the equation of a line parallel to $y = 2x + 5$ and passes through the point $(4, 3)$
  - To find `m`, use the equation of the given line and isolate `y` in it. Whatever appears next to `x` is your slope. In this problem, we can already see the slope is 2
  - $m = 2$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
    - $y - 3 = 2(x - 4)$
    - $y - 3 = 2x - 8$
    - $y = 2x - 5$
- Write the equation of a line perpendicular to $3y = x - 4$ and passes through the point $(-2, 1)$
  - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
    - $y - 1 = m(x - (-2))$
    - $y = -3x - 5$
  - To find slope, use the given equation and isolate `y`
    - $y = \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{4}{3}$
    - $m = \frac{1}{3}$
- Write the equation of a line where the line passes through $(-2, 0)$ and $(-2, 5)$
  - Because both x values are the same, the line is vertical
  - The slope is undefined, so $x = -2$
- Write the equation of a line where the line passes through $(1, 7)$ and $(3, 7)$
  - Because both y values are the same, the line is horizontal
  - The slope is zero
  - $y = 7$
- Write the equation of a line where the slope is undefined and passes through the point $(2, 3)$
  - Slope of the line is undefined, so the line is vertical
  - $x = 2$
- Write the equation of a line where the slope is zero and passes through the point $(1, -4)$
  - $m = 0$
  - $y = -4$
