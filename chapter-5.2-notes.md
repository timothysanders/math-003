## 5.2: Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

---
In-class notes
- Power functions and polynomial functions
  - Power function has a single term raised to a fixed positive integer power
    - It cannot be a fraction or a negative integer power
    - Power function only has a variable in the base
  - Polynomial function is a function that has a positive integer (non-fractional) degree of one variable
    - For example, $y = x^2$ is a polynomial function
    - Linear function is also a polynomial function
  - You have as many solutions (real/complex) as the term of highest degree
- When visualizing functions, look to the leading coefficient
  - If the leading coefficient is negative, then the right hand side of the graph is pointed down
  - If the leading coefficient is positive, then the right hand side of the graph is pointed up
- Look to the term of highest degree
  - If you have an odd degree, then the "arms" of the functions are pointed in different directions
  - If you have an even degree, then the "arms" of the functions are pointed in the same directions
  - Odd degree functions always cross the x-axis
  - Even degree functions may not cross the x-axis
- Quadratic function formats
  - Standard
    - $y = ax^2 + bx + c$
  - Vertex
    - $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$
  - Factored
    - $y = a(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$
  - Other
    - Need to remove parentheses and start over
- If you have a quadratic graph...
  - Where the line crosses the x-axis
    - Then you have two real solutions
  - If the line just touches, you have one double (multiplicity) real root solution
  - If the graph does not cross the x-axis
    - Then you have two complex solutions (no real solutions)
      - Complex solutions always come in conjugate pairs
- Vertex
  - $(h, k)$
  - part of the vertex can be found with $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$
- End behavior
  - "As x goes to $\pm\infty$"
  - $y = ax^n$
- Symmetry
  - Symmetry about the y-axis
    - $y = ax^n$
    - This only applies to even powers (but not all even power functions)
      - $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ both have the same y
    - Functions that satisfy this condition are called "even functions"
      - Note that even degree functions are not necessarily "even functions" as they are not symmetric about the y-axis
      - For an even function, it is essential to have all even degrees
  - Symmetry about origin
    - These are odd power functions
    - These are called "odd functions"
    - $f(x) = -f(-x)$
    - For an odd function, it is essential that you have all odd degrees
  - If a function has even and odd degrees, then it is not symmetric about the y-axis or origin
  - $y = x^6 - 3x^4 + 1$
    - Polynomial function
    - Even degree function
    - $f(-x) = (-x)^6 - 3(-x)^4 + 1 = x^6 - 3x^4 + 1$
    - This is an "even function" because both $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ return the same value
  - $y = x^5 - 4x$
    - This is an odd degree function
    - $f(-x) = (-x)^5 - 4(-x) = -x^5 + 4x = -(x^5 - 4x) = -f(x)$
  - $y = x^7 - x^6 + 4x^2 - 1$
    - $f(-x) = (-x)^7 - (-x)^6 + 4(-x)^2 - 1 = -x^7 - x^6 + 4x^2 - 1$
    - This is an odd power function
    - But, this is not an "odd function"
- $f(x) = 0.2(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 5)$
  - This is in factored form
  - degree is three
  - to check leading coefficient, check the sign of all x
  - To get y-intercept, let x = 0
