## 3.2: Domain and Range

In-class notes
- Non-linear inequalities
- $3x = 15$
  - $x = \frac{15}{3}$
  - $x = 5$
  - Write the answer in interval notation: $x = \{5\}$ (the braces mean a "discrete point")
- $3x \lt -15$
  - $x \lt -\frac{15}{3}$
  - $x \lt -5$
  - Write the answer in interval notation: $x = (-\infty, -5)$
- $-3x \leq 15$
  - $x \geq -\frac{15}{3}$
  - $x \geq -5$
  - Write the answer in interval notation: $x = [-5, \infty)$
- $-\frac{1}{3} \gt 15$
  - Multiply by the reciprocal
  - $(-3)-\frac{1}{3} \lt 15(-3)$
  - $x \lt 45$
  - Write in interval notation: x = (-\infty, -45)
- $\frac{x}{2} \lt 2$
  - Multiply by the reciprocal
  - $$
- When a variable is in the denominator, **DO NOT MULTIPLY** by its reciprocal in rational inequalities
  - Get zero on one size
  - $\frac{3}{x} \lt 6$
  - $\frac{3}{x} - 6 \lt 0$
  - $\frac{3}{x} - \frac{6x}{1x} \lt 0$
  - $\frac{3 - 6x}{x} \lt 0$
  - Then analyze when the left size is < 0, which means negative
  - Factor completely numerator and denominator
- $\frac{(x - 2)(x + 5)}{x(x - 4)(x + 7)} \geq 0$
  - Draw a number line and plot the numbers where $x$ is equal to zero for each of the factors
  - Remember that the denominator can never be equal to zero
  - Pick a number from each area on the number line and determine whether it produces a negative or positive number
- $\frac{x}{2} - \frac{5}{x + 1} - 4 \lt 0$
  - When you have an inequality with a variable in the denominator, you do not clear the variable from the denominator, instead you find the LCD
  - Find the LCD: $2(x + 1)$
  - $\frac{(x + 1)}{(x + 1)}\frac{x}{2} - $
  - $\frac{x(x + 1) - 10 - 8(x + 1)}{2(x + 1)} \lt 0$
  - $\frac{x^2 - 1 - 10 - 8x - 8}{2(x + 1)} \lt 0$
  - \frac{x^2 - 7x - 18}{2(x + 1)} \lt 0
  - $\frac{(x - 9)(x + 2)}{2(x + 1)} \lt 0$
  - Draw the number line and plot the points for each factor that contains a variable, in this instance, $x = 9, x = -2, x = -1$
    - Choose numbers from each interval to test your inequality
  - If the inequality is not equal to zero, then all of your intervals are "open"
- If there is no variable in the denominator, it is a linear equation, so you can clear the variable
- $\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{1 - r} = \frac{4}{r^2}$
- **Domain** is the difference between the minimum and the maximum value of x
  - Domain is the width of the picture frame
- **Range** is the difference between the minimum and the maximum value of y
  - Range is the height of the picture frame
- Domain and range exist to indicate to show what you can use for your independent variable and what you will get as a result for your dependent variable
- **Parent function** has just `x`, no transformations
  - For example, the parent function of radical functions is $y = \sqrt{x}$
- To help graph a function, you can create a T table and start plugging in numbers

| $x$ | $y = \sqrt{x}$ |
|-----|----------------|
| 0   | 0              |
| 1   | 1              |
| 4   | 2              |
| 9   | 3              |

- $y = 3x + 5$
  - For linear functions, `x` can be all real numbers, $x = (-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$
- $y = x^2 - 3x + 7$
  - For quadratic functions, `x` can be all real numbers, $x = (-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$
- $y = \sqrt{x - 1} + 2$
  - For an even root, you need to be on alert
  - Under the radical, you must require non-negative numbers
- $y = \sqrt[3]{x - 1}$
  - For an odd root, `x` can be all real numbers, $(-\infty, \infty)$
- $y = \frac{1}{x^2 - 5x + 4}$
  - You must have a non-zero denominator
  - Factor the denominator, and check for the values where x ends up becoming zero
- $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 4}}$
- $y = \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 5x + 4}}$
  - $x^2 - 5x + 4 \ne 0$
  - $(x - 4)(x - 1) \ne 0$
  - $x \ne 4; x \ne 1$
- $y = \frac{3}{x - 5}$
  - For this rational function, we cannot have $x - 5 = 0; x = 5$
  - $x \gt 5 \cup x \lt 5$
  - $(-\infty, 5)\cup(5, \infty)$
- For domain, what are the set of good `x` values that I can use where I will never have any trouble?
  - Domain is more easily findable than range, domain can typically be determined from the function
