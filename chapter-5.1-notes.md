## 5.1: Quadratic Functions

### Recognizing Characteristics of Parabolas
- The graph of a quadratic equation is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. It has an extreme point, called the **vertex**.
  - If the parabola opens upward, the vertex is the lowest point on the graph (or the minimum value of the quadratic function)
  - If the parabola opens downward, the vertex is the highest point on the graph (or the maximum value of the quadratic function)
- The graph of a quadratic function is symmetric with a vertical line that goes through the vertex, called the **axis of symmetry**
- The y-intercept is the point at which the parabola crosses the y-axis and the x-intercepts (plural) are the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis. If x-intercepts exist, they represent the **zeros** or **roots** of the quadratic function, the values of x at which y = 0
