## 2.7: Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value Inequalities
### Using Interval Notation
- Three different ways to represent an inequality
  - Draw a number line
  - Use set-builder notation $\{x|x \geq 4\}$
  - **Interval notation**, where solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets
    - In our example, $x \geq 4 = [4, \infty)$
    - In interval notation, parentheses represent solutions greater than or equal to and less than or equal to
    - Use parentheses to represent infinity or negative infinity
    - $[-2, 6)$ = all numbers between -2 and 6, including -2 but not including 6
    - $(1, 0)$ = all real numbers betwee, but not including -1 and 0
    - $(-\infty, 1]$ = all real numbers less than and including 1

### Using the Properties of Inequalities
- When working with inequalities, we can typically treat them similarly to the way we treat equalities. For example, we can use the addition property and the multiplication property to help solve them. One very important caveat though is if you multiply or divide by a negative number **THE INEQUALITY SYMBOL IS REVERSED**
##### Properties of Inequalities
  - **Addition Property**
    - if $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$
  - **Multiplication Property**
    - if $a < b$ and $c > 0$, then $ac < bc$
      - ex. a = 1, b = 3, c = 2: $(1)(2) < (3)(2)$
    - if $a < b$ and $c < 0$, then $ac > bc$
      - ex. a = 1, b = 3, c = -1: $(1)(-1) > (3)(-1)$
  - These properties also apply to $a \leq b$, $a \gt b$, and $a \geq b$
##### Examples
- $x - 15 \lt 4$
  - $x \lt 19$
- $6 \geq x - 1$
  - $x \leq 7$
- $x + 7 \gt 9$
  - $x \gt 2$
- $3x \lt 6$
  - $x \lt 2$
- $-2x - 1 \geq 5$
  - $-2x \geq 6$
  - $x \leq -3$
### Solving Inequalities in One Variable Algebraically
- The same as equations, we can perform the same operations on both sides of an inequality to combine like terms and perform operations. Solving involves isolating the variable
##### Examples
- $13 - 7x \geq 10x - 4$
  - $17 \geq 17x; 1 \geq x$
  - The solution set is $(-\infty, 1]$, or all real numbers less than and including 1
### Understanding Compound Inequalities
- A **compound inequality** includes two inequalities in one statement, such as $4 \lt x \leq 6$, which means $4 \lt x$ and $x \leq 6$. These can be solved by separating the two inequalities and solving individually, or performing operations on all three parts at the same time
##### Examples
- $3 \leq 2x + 2 \lt 6$
  - $3 \leq 2x + 2$
  - $2x \geq 1; x \geq \frac{1}{2}$
  - $2x + 2 \lt 6$
  - $2x \lt 4$
  - $x \lt 2$
  - Solution set $[\frac{1}{2}, 2)$
### Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
- The absolute value of any quantity is a positive number or zero. Absolute value inequalities are in the form
  - $|A| \lt B; |A| \leq B; |A| \gt B; |A| \geq B$
- Where $A$ and sometimes $B$ represent algebraic expressions dependent on the variable $x$. Solving the inequality means finding the set of all $x$ values that satisfy the problem, usually this is an interval, or a union of two intervals, and includes a range of values
- Two basic approaches to solving absolute value inequalities are graphical and algebraic, algebraic gives you exact answers, while graphical can be more intuitive (but less precise)
  - $|x - 600| \leq 200$
    - $-200 \leq x - 600 \leq 200$
    - $400 \leq x \leq 800$
##### Absolute Value Inequalities
- For an algebraic equation $X$, and $k \gt 0$, an **absolute value inequality** is an inequality of the form
  - $|X| \lt k$ is equivalent to $-k \lt X \lt k$
  - $|X| \gt k$ is equivalent to $X \lt -k$ or $X \gt k$
- These statements also apply to $|X| \leq k$ and $|X| \geq k$
##### Examples
- $|x - 1| \leq 3$
  - $-3 \leq x - 1 \leq 3$
  - $-2 \leq x \leq 4$
  - Solution set is [-2, 4]
