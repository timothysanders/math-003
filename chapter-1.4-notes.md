## 1.4 Polynomials
### Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of Polynomials
- **polynomial**: sum or difference of terms, with each term consisting of a variable raised to a non-negative integer power. **coefficient** is a number multiplied by a variable raised to an exponent (ex. $384\pi$). Coefficients can be positive/negative/zero and can be whole numbers/decimals/fractions. Each product is called a **term of a polynomial** and if it does not contain a variable, it is called a **constant**
- Polynomials with only one term are called **monomial** (such as $5x^4)$, two terms is a **binomial** (such as $2x - 9$), three terms is called a **trinomial** (such as $-3x^2 + 8x - 7$)
- The **degree** of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial, this is the **leading term** and is usually written first. The coefficient of the leading term is called the **leading coefficient**. *Standard form* for a polynomial is when it is written so that powers are descending
- A **polynomial** is an expression that can be written in the form $a_{n}x^n + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$
  - Each real term $a_i$ is called a **coefficient**
  - In this instance, $a_0$ is called a **constant** because it is not multiplied by a variable
  - Each product of $a_ix^i$ is a **term of a polynomial
  - The highest power that occurs across the polynomial is called the **degree**, the **leading term** is the term with the highest power, its coefficient is called the **leading coefficient**
- Example 1.a: $3 + 2x^2 - 4x^3$
  - Degree: $3$
  - Leading term: $-4x^3$
  - Leading coefficient: $-4$
- Example 1.b: $5t^5 - 2t^3 + 7t$
  - Degree: $5$
  - Leading term: $5t^5$
  - Leading coefficient: $5$
- Example 1.c: $6p - p^3 -2$
  - Degree: $3$
  - Leading term: $-p^3$
  - Leading coefficient: $-1$
- Example 1.1: $4x^2 - x^6 + 2x - 6$
  - Degree: $6$
  - Leading term: $-x^6$
  - Leading coefficient $-1$
### Adding and subtracting polynomials
- Polynomials can be added and subtracted by combining like terms (terms with the same variables raised to the same exponents)
  - Example: $5x^2$ and $-2x^2$ are like terms and can be combined to get $3x^2$, but $3x^2$ and $-2x^2$ are not like terms
- Example 2.1: $(12x^2 + 9x - 21) + (4x^3 + 8x^2 - 5x + 20)$
  - $4x^3 + 20x^2 + 4x - 1$
- Example 2.2: $(2x^3 + 5x^2 - x + 1) + (2x^2 - 3x - 4)$
  - $2x^3 + 7x^2 - 4x - 3$
- Example 3.1: $(7x^4 - x^2 + 6x + 1) - (5x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 2)$
  - $7x^4 - 5x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 1$
- Example 3.2: $(-7x^3 - 7x^2 + 6x - 2) - (4x^3 - 6x^2 - x + 7)$
  - $-11x^3 - x^2 + 7x - 9$
### Multiplying Polynomials
- When multiplying polynomials, must use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second
#### Multiplying polynomials using the Distributive property
- To multiply a polynomial by a number, distribute the number, for example $2(x + 7) = 2x + 14$. After multiplying, combine like terms and simplify.
- Example 4.1: $(2x + 1)(3x^2 - x + 4)$
    - $6x^3 - 2x^2 + 8x + 3x^2 - x + 4 = 6x^3 + x^2 + 7x + 4$
- Example 4.2: $(3x + 2)(x^3 - 4x^2 + 7)$
    - $3x^4 - 12x^3 + 21x + 2x^3 - 8x^2 + 14 = 3x^4 - 9x^3 - 8x^2 + 21x + 14$
##### Using FOIL to multiply binomials
- **FOIL: First Outer Inner Last**: sometimes used to find the product of two binomials
- Example 5.1: $(2x - 18)(3x + 3)$
    - First: $6x^2$ Outer: $6x$ Inner: $-54x$ Last: $-54$
    - $6x^2 - 48x - 54$
- Example 5.2: $(x + 7)(3x - 5)$
    - First: $3x^2$ Outer: $-5x$ Inner: $21x$ Last: $-35$
    - $3x^2 + 16x - 35$
##### Perfect Square Trinomials
- When a binomial is squared, the result is called a **perfect square trinomial**. The first term of the trinomial is the square of the first term and the last term is the square of the last term. The middle term is the double of the product of the two terms
- Examples
    - $(x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25$
    - $(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$
    - $(4x - 1)^2 = 16x^2 - 8x + 1$
- Example 6.1: $(3x - 8)^2$
    - $9x^2 - 48x + 64$
- Example 6.2: $(4x - 1)^2$
    - $16x^2 - 8x + 1$
##### Difference of Squares
- **Difference of squares** occurs when you multiply by another binomial with the same terms, but opposite signs, for example $(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 + 1x - 1x - 1 = x^2 - 1$. In this, the inner and outer terms cancel out, the result is the square of the first term minus the square of the last term
- Generic form: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- Example 7.1: $(9x + 4)(9x - 4)$
    - $81x^2 - 16$
- Example 7.2: $(2x + 7)(2x - 7)$
    - $4x^2 - 49$
#### Performing Operations with Polynomials of Several Variables
- All the same rules for polynomials with one variable apply when considering polynomials with more than one variable
- Example 8.1: $(x + 4)(3x - 2y + 5)$
    - $3x^2 - 2xy + 5x + 12x - 8y + 20 = 3x^2 - 2xy + 17x - 8y + 20$
- Example 8.2: $(3x - 1)(2x + 7y - 9)$
    - $6x^2 + 21xy - 27x - 2x - 7y + 9 = 6x^2 + 21xy - 29x - 7y + 9$
