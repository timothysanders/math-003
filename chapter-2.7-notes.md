## 2.7: Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value Inequalities
### Using Interval Notation
- Three different ways to represent an inequality
  - Draw a number line
  - Use set-builder notation $\{x|x \geq 4\}$
  - **Interval notation**, where solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets
    - In our example, $x \geq 4 = [4, \infty)$
    - In interval notation, parentheses represent solutions greater than or equal to and less than or equal to
    - Use parentheses to represent infinity or negative infinity
    - $[-2, 6)$ = all numbers between -2 and 6, including -2 but not including 6
    - $(1, 0)$ = all real numbers betwee, but not including -1 and 0
    - $(-\infty, 1]$ = all real numbers less than and including 1

### Using the Properties of Inequalities
- When working with inequalities, we can typically treat them similarly to the way we treat equalities. For example, we can use the addition property and the multiplication property to help solve them. One very important caveat though is if you multiply or divide by a negative number **THE INEQUALITY SYMBOL IS REVERSED**
- Properties of Inequalities
  - **Addition Property**
    - if $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$
  - **Multiplication Property**
    - if $a < b$ and $c > 0$, then $ac < bc$
      - ex. a = 1, b = 3, c = 2: $(1)(2) < (3)(2)$
    - if $a < b$ and $c < 0$, then $ac > bc$
      - ex. a = 1, b = 3, c = -1: $(1)(-1) > (3)(-1)$
  - These properties also apply to $a \leq b$, $a \gt b$, and $a \geq b$
